# Log Extender
Adds more logs to the Logs directory the Project Zomboid game.

## Description
The Log Extender mod is designed for Project Zomboid servers and adds log entries that helps administering the server.
The mod allows you to save information about the levels of perk character, the time of his survival, the number of killed zombies and other 
information about the character, which, as you know, is stored on users' local computers. The mod also fixes several game bugs that are related
with logging the actions of players. For example, a record is added about taking a generator from the ground. You can read more about this bugreport
